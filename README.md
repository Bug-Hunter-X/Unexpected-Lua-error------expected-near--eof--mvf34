This repository demonstrates a common Lua error where a syntax error is reported at the end of file (EOF), even though the function seems to have correct syntax.  The problem arises from implicit argument passing where an expected argument is missing during the function call. While the example shows missing arguments directly, such issues can arise when dealing with optional parameters or when combining functions and tables.
